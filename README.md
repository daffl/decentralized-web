### YYCjs Slide Template

Our template for our monthly slide deck using [cleaver](http://jdan.github.io/cleaver). Feel free to rip it off if you would like.

To use it locally, there are 3 steps to instant gratification:

1. `npm install -g cleaver`
2. Write [your slides as markdown](https://github.com/yycjs/slide-template/blob/gh-pages/slides.md)
3. `npm install`
4. `grunt watch`


#### Special Classes

To make your slides look a little nice there are a few special classes that you can use with this theme.

* `title`
* `presenter`
* `sponsors`
* `image`
